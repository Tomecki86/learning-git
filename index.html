				<p>Frozen realm of the eternal snows,<br>
Where severe winter rise and enthroned,<br>
Land of the silence and sorrow,<br>
Keeping echoes of times. <br>
<br>
Undgracious edge of the northern winds,<br>
Cold kingdom of the forgotten kings,<br>
Here today like tomorrow,<br>
Under pale Rays of moonlight.<br>
<br>
"...I hear the call of winterforest,<br>
I am entering the winterforest,<br>
Wisdom comes to me in winterforest,<br>
My home under trees of winterforest..."<br>
<br>
Visions and shadows surround me,<br>
My heart feels winter's majesty,<br>
And greatness of the past ages,<br>
Touch my soul by snowstorm.<br>
<br>
Under vault of trees, in serenity,<br>
The ominous mist cloud like mystery,<br>
I see his ghosty face,<br>
And drowned in this eyes, I reborn.<br>
<br>
Find the wisdom,<br>
I hear echoes of the winterforest...</p>
